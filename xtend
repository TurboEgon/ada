Like most in the crypto scene, we started with Bitcoin, but ended up with the Cardano network due to the functionality and sustainability of the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. The Cardano ecosystem, in our opinion, offers an attractive mix of security, scalability, and decentralization, allowing many people around the world to easily and securely access the crypto space.",
